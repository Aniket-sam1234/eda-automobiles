**Data Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile

The project deals with two major analysis :
- 1. Relationship of a car's symboling value with its body style and physical parameters
- 2. Relationship of a car's pricing with its body style, size and engine specifications

** Python notebooks used for analysis work:**
